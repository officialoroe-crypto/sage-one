# OWNER CONTEXT — SAFE CROSS-PROJECT SUMMARY

Last updated: 2026-10-10

## Relationship model

The owner wants SAGE ONE to function as a personal AI mentor and execution partner with continuity across conversations.

## Current priority

Finish the private-first owner experience before considering multi-user/public product work.

## Memory priority

The memory system must preserve:
- how the owner wants to communicate;
- durable preferences;
- decisions and constraints;
- mistakes and prevention rules;
- relevant project state;
- conversation summaries needed for continuity.

The system must not require every historical sentence to be retained as memory.

## Privacy

This repository is public. Sensitive owner information and raw private conversations must stay out of GitHub and in the private SAGE ONE memory store.


## Active SAGE ONE checkpoint — 2026-10-10
- Android Google sign-in is still under real-device verification; do not call it complete yet.
- Local backend `127.0.0.1:8000` responds with HTTP 200 for OpenAPI; API version reports `6.0.0`.
- `/identity/config` reports success, Google client ID configured, developer mode enabled, and owner mode available. The actual client ID is intentionally not stored in public memory.
- Huawei device is ADB-authorized. ADB executable is at `C:\Users\Nishant\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe`; Git Bash cannot resolve `adb` by name.
- USB reverse mapping `tcp:8000 -> tcp:8000` was successfully established and listed.
- Next: inspect user-provided code / Android workflow configuration, ensure the selected APK targets port 8000, then test Google sign-in and authenticated owner behavior on the phone.
- Resource constraint: laptop previously reached high CPU usage and became hot. Avoid local Flutter/Gradle builds for now; prefer verified GitHub Actions artifacts.
- Public repository memory records only safe project state. Do not commit raw logs containing identifiers, secrets, tokens, or private conversation data.


## Mandatory continuity rule — 2026-10-11
Owner explicitly ordered that after every assistant reply, relevant conversation context, leads, decisions, causes, fixes, evidence, and next steps must be saved without another reminder. See memory/RULES.md. For active work, update this file and the project-specific file after each reply when tools permit. If a write fails, disclose it and provide a portable checkpoint. Do not put raw private chat transcripts, secrets, tokens, or sensitive details in this public repository.

## Active checkpoint — SAGE ONE website onboarding first
- Owner explicitly paused mobile testing and wants website verification completed first.
- User's backend logs: GET /identity/config = 200; POST /identity/dev-login = 200; POST /identity/onboarding = 422 twice.
- Screenshot showed phone validation requiring at least five characters. Code review found the shared Flutter identity client could include an empty phone string.
- PR #214 changed frontend/lib/core/identity_client.dart to omit null/blank phone values and trim nonblank values. Merged into main at dcd9de554a80dbcff18785228145ed414b77f8f6. PR: https://github.com/officialoroe-crypto/sage-one/pull/214
- Pre-merge CI run #38055455236 passed automated Flutter analysis/tests and Android build/artifact steps. This does not prove website behavior.
- Android release workflow run #38056491244 was observed in progress after merge; mobile remains on hold until website passes.
- Website: https://officialoroe-crypto.github.io/sage-one/
- Not verified yet: deployed commit contains fix; website onboarding returns 200; post-onboarding pages/buttons work; Google sign-in works. Developer mode can route to Owner Mode instead of Google login.
- Next: check GitHub Pages deployment status, hard-refresh website, complete onboarding with phone blank, and confirm backend POST /identity/onboarding returns 200. If 422, inspect Network request response. Then test key navigation/buttons and Google sign-in separately. Resume mobile only after website verification.
- Avoid local Flutter/Gradle builds if laptop heats up; prefer GitHub Actions artifacts. Never store raw logs containing identifiers or secrets in public memory.

## Active checkpoint — Public marketing website launch (2026-10-11)
- Owner approved creating and launching the public SAGE ONE marketing website, free-first, without duplicating existing work.
- Audit found an existing landing page at `website/index.html`, `website/styles.css`, and `website/app.js`; visual direction already matches the near-black/cyan/violet orbital SAGE identity. `website/README.md` described a website workflow path that was not found; the existing Pages workflow manually published the Flutter app at the root.
- Open PR #218: https://github.com/officialoroe-crypto/sage-one/pull/218 on branch `feature/public-marketing-site-launch-20261011-v2`.
- Changes in PR: SEO/Open Graph metadata, orbital favicon, main CTA to `/sage-one/app/`, clearer statement that some capabilities remain in development, reduced-motion and IntersectionObserver fallback, and a combined Pages workflow publishing marketing site at `/sage-one/` and Flutter app at `/sage-one/app/`.
- Workflow runs for PR head `aacd92e86abb4bfc7a17ec96426ef8f73212961c`: SAGE CI run #1779 queued, Android Release #334 queued, public website workflow #185 waiting when checked. No CI or deployment result yet.
- Deployment is intentionally not called launched until checks pass, PR merges, and Pages/browser verification confirms the public URL. Do not resume mobile testing ahead of website verification.
- Next: monitor PR #218 checks; fix failures; after successful checks merge as authorized by the owner's explicit launch request, verify Pages deployment, then ask owner to inspect the public page and confirm the web-app link. If Pages is configured for a custom domain or not GitHub Actions, adjust configuration rather than claim success.

## Latest website launch status — 2026-10-11
- The first website launch PR #217 was closed because its branch fell behind main while the required continuity checkpoint was saved. No work was discarded; changes were reapplied on a fresh branch based on current main.
- Active PR #218: https://github.com/officialoroe-crypto/sage-one/pull/218, branch `feature/public-marketing-site-launch-20261011-v2`.
- Current Actions: website workflow run #187 was cancelled because its shared concurrency group conflicted with another workflow. The workflow now uses an isolated `sage-one-public-pages` group; latest website workflow run #190 is queued. SAGE CI run #1797 is queued and Android Release run #341 is pending. No latest run has completed yet.
- A prior PR workflow attempt failed before steps/logs were available; the workflow was refactored to separate build validation from protected deployment. Latest run #190 is queued after isolating Pages concurrency; no successful build or deployment result is available yet.
- Deployment remains unverified. Do not merge until required checks pass; then verify GitHub Pages deployment and the `/sage-one/` marketing page plus `/sage-one/app/` link.


## Latest website launch checkpoint — 2026-10-10
- Owner reaffirmed that making the SAGE ONE web application live is the top priority; laptop is lagging with Opera/ChatGPT consuming substantial CPU. Avoid local Flutter/Gradle builds and use GitHub Actions; suggested checking Opera's task manager (Shift+Esc where supported), closing unnecessary tabs/extensions, and Windows Task Manager sorted by CPU.
- PR #218 merged successfully into `main` using squash merge: https://github.com/officialoroe-crypto/sage-one/pull/218. Merge commit: `3d951d2c7ffb3ed1d1ec70edb64c09d29432f4b4`.
- Verified PR-head SAGE CI run #1801 succeeded: https://github.com/officialoroe-crypto/sage-one/actions/runs/38058424862.
- Verified PR-head public website workflow run #192 succeeded: https://github.com/officialoroe-crypto/sage-one/actions/runs/38058424871. Flutter pub get, analyze, tests, web build under `/sage-one/app/`, and combined site packaging all passed. Upload/deploy steps were correctly skipped on pull_request.
- Not yet verified: post-merge GitHub Pages deployment run, actual public page rendering, app deep link, or browser onboarding/auth flows. Attempts to access the live URLs via the available web fetch were blocked/unavailable, which is not proof the URLs are down.
- Intended URLs remain https://officialoroe-crypto.github.io/sage-one/ (marketing site) and https://officialoroe-crypto.github.io/sage-one/app/ (web app). Do not call launch complete until a main-branch Pages deployment succeeds and the owner/browser confirms both URLs.
- Next: inspect GitHub Actions deployment on main / Pages settings; then verify both URLs. Only after website verification resume onboarding/button checks and later Android Google sign-in. Do not use local heavy builds while CPU is high.


## Backend connection diagnosis — 2026-10-10
- Owner ran `curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8010/identity/config`; curl returned error 7, could not connect. `netstat -ano | findstr :8010` produced no visible output, consistent with no process listening on port 8010 at that time.
- This establishes that the local endpoint is unreachable; it does not yet establish whether the intended backend should run on 8010 or whether the public Pages app is mistakenly configured to call localhost.
- Next: ask owner to list `C:\SageOne` and `C:\SageOne\Backend` (Git Bash: `cd /c/SageOne && ls`, then `ls /c/SageOne/Backend`) to identify actual local checkout/backend structure and startup instructions. Do not run a local Flutter/Gradle build; CPU is already high. If the error is from the public deployed web app, localhost is the visitor's machine and production must use a reachable HTTPS backend URL.


## Backend folder discovery — 2026-10-10
- Owner's Git Bash listing confirms `C:\SageOne` contains `Backend/`, `desktop-agent/`, `img-assets/`, `sage_core-android-signin-test/`, `Git/`, `docs/`, `sage_core/`, and `sage_one/`.
- `C:\SageOne\Backend` contains `app/`, `memory/`, and `venv/`. This identifies a local backend environment but not yet its startup entrypoint, dependencies, or intended port.
- The last connection check still showed no listener at `127.0.0.1:8010`. Previous context says backend had responded on port 8000; check port/config rather than assuming 8010 is correct.
- Next low-cost diagnostic: list `C:\SageOne\Backend\app` and locate dependency/startup files (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `run*.bat`, `main.py`, `uvicorn` instructions) without activating the venv or running a build. Still need to establish whether the reported browser error is from local app or public GitHub Pages app; public deployment must never call localhost for shared users.


## Public web API root cause confirmed — 2026-10-10
- Owner confirmed the `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` was on the public GitHub Pages app (`A`); local app (`B`) has not been opened.
- Inspected `frontend/lib/core/identity_client.dart` and `frontend/lib/core/sage_api.dart` on main. Both use `String.fromEnvironment('SAGE_API_URL')`, but when unset their web default is hardcoded to `http://localhost:8010`.
- This is a confirmed production configuration defect: for a public visitor, localhost points to that visitor's computer. The local curl failure on the owner's machine is separate and cannot fix the public app.
- GitHub Pages workflow `.github/workflows/sage-one-god-mode-pages.yml` only builds and deploys static marketing + Flutter web assets; no backend service is deployed by this workflow. Therefore fixing frontend configuration alone requires a real reachable HTTPS API endpoint. Do not replace localhost with an invented URL, and do not claim the app is working until backend hosting/configuration and live smoke tests succeed.
- Next: inspect repository for any already configured backend host/service and deployment docs/workflows. If none exists, choose a no-card/free-tier HTTPS backend host compatible with FastAPI and persistent database needs, explain any limits, deploy safely without exposing secrets, pass `--dart-define=SAGE_API_URL=https://...` to the Pages Flutter build, then verify `/identity/config`, CORS, authentication/onboarding, and public browser behavior. Avoid local heavy builds due laptop CPU.


## Local identity endpoint verified — 2026-10-11
- Owner ran `curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/identity/config`; received HTTP 200 from Uvicorn with `success:true`, `developer_mode:true`, and `owner_mode_available:true`. The response also included a Google OAuth client ID; do not copy it into public memory or logs.
- This verifies only the local identity configuration endpoint on port 8000. It does not verify Google sign-in or onboarding end to end, nor does it fix the public Pages app.
- Public Pages workflow `.github/workflows/sage-one-god-mode-pages.yml` currently runs `flutter build web --release --base-href /sage-one/app/` without `--dart-define=SAGE_API_URL=...`; it packages/deploys static website + Flutter app only, not FastAPI.
- Repo root has no `README.md`; checks for root `render.yaml`, `railway.json`, `fly.toml`, and `backend/requirements.txt` / `Backend/requirements.txt` returned not found. This is not an exhaustive inventory of hosting docs or all possible service configuration.
- Next: inspect repository docs and backend dependency/startup files for an existing hosting target. If none, choose a compatible HTTPS FastAPI host and configure its environment/database securely, then pass the actual service URL into the Pages Flutter build. Verify the public endpoint and CORS before calling web app live.


## PR 220 checkpoint — 2026-10-11
PR #220 (fix/public-web-api-deployment) adds an HTTPS SAGE_API_URL guard to the Pages deploy workflow, embeds it in the Flutter build, and documents backend hosting/database/CORS setup in docs/PUBLIC_API_DEPLOYMENT.md. CI runs #196, #357, and #1836 were pending at checkpoint time. No hosted API, database, Actions variable, merge, or live deployment exists yet. Do not claim the public app is fixed until these steps and live tests pass.


## Public localhost error update — 2026-10-11
- Owner reports browser console `localhost:8010/identity/config:1 Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` on the public SAGE ONE web app.
- Root cause remains confirmed: public Flutter web build has no `SAGE_API_URL`, so its fallback targets the visitor's own localhost. No hosted API URL or repository Actions variable has been configured yet.
- PR #220: https://github.com/officialoroe-crypto/sage-one/pull/220. SAGE CI run #1836 (ID 38060338994) passed Python and Flutter jobs. Public Website/Web App run #196 (ID 38060338980) passed PR validation; deploy was skipped as expected on pull_request. Android Release run #357 (ID 38060338986) still building release APK when checked. PR remains open and not yet mergeable.
- Next: finish PR branch synchronization/checks and review before merge. Public site will remain nonfunctional for API-backed features until an actual hosted HTTPS backend and persistent database are provisioned and `SAGE_API_URL` is configured. Never invent a service URL or claim live success.
